1. "I've checked if I had the lastest version of the Repository Challenges 05"
2. "After that I went to the main branch and create new branches with name Challenges + number of the challenge and short description (ex. Challenge 06 - Git&GitLab)"
3. "After creating new branch, I use the command  git push --set-upstream origin <branch name> to push the branch on remote repository"
4. "After that I put all the files and images and use the command git add . and git commit -m to add all the changes on that local branch"
5. "After carefully checking the branches and the content inside, I use the command git push to add all files on the remote repositury"
6. "I use this commands for all branches which I made (Total 5 branches including the last branch Challenge 06)"
7. "Double checked on gitlab if the branches and this txt is there"


Thank you for taking the time to check out my challenge. I hope you have a great day. :)
